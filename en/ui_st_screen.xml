		<text>The Kvazar object is an intangible form of reasonable nature, first recorded after the incident in the zone of a split in reality at a depth of 480 meters under the sea level in the Karst formation "Head of Saturn". Outwardly, it does not manifest, but has a powerful psychocognitive effect on everyone who is in the radius of its "look" (conditional term). The nature of influence is the stretching, exposure and stimulation of suppressed impulses, destructive emotions and moral deviations of the subject.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_ecolog_pda_note_3">
		<text>The object does not emit electromagnetic waves, does not absorb light and is not fixed on the chambers. The only way of its presence is behavioral changes in people nearby.</text>

	<string id="esc_ecolog_pda_note_5">
		<text>At the moment, a working hypothesis is put forward: “Quasar” is not an independent mind in the usual sense, but an amplifier of sin, an energy resonator that enhances the lower impulses of the soul. This is not a creature, but a catalyst for moral decay. \ n possible explanations: \ n 1) a quantum-psychic entity that feeds on cognitive distortions. \ n 2) something that exists "on the other side of morality" that does not perceive good and evil, but enhancing the conflict between them. \ N 3) An illusory mirror that distorts the reflection of a person until he himself believes in the monster in him.</text>

		<text>1) the approach to the object should be accompanied by two observers with autonomous neural locking. \ n 2) prevent persons with psyche disorders, religious exaltation and a tendency to wine. \ N 3) In the case of verbal contact with the object, it is forbidden to respond - any reverse speech causes an increase in exposure.</text>

	<string id="esc_ecolog_pda_note_7">
		<text>With each new session, it is more difficult for me to separate thoughts from the influence of the object. Sometimes, looking at the notes, I do not recognize my voice. He sounds ... more confident. Smarter. Colder. But he is not me. I think no. I hope not.</text>

		<text>Subject No. 6 (guard, age 41): \ n 4 minutes after approaching the chamber showed stable symptoms of paranoia, then an attack of verbal aggression. In the 9th minute, he admitted to the drown of his own brother in childhood. After 12 minutes, he tried to open, screaming: \ n "I thought, I forgot ... But it made me remember!"</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_ecolog_pda_note_42">
		<text>Subject No. 12 (Assistant, age 28): \ n first demonstrated anxiety, then - a transobed state. She said in a voice that did not belong to her: \ n "In each of you I like mold. You rot, and I am your warmth." \ n after waking up she refused to speak, eyes were not focused.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_ecolog_pda_note_43">
		<text>The subject No. 19 (volunteer, monk-Jesuit): \ N showed pronounced sadistic inclinations, admitted the thoughts of violence against parishioners. After breaking the contact with the object, he cried continuously for 6 hours. Repeated contact caused convulsions and complete braking of speech. Neuroscaning revealed new neural ties in the temporal lobe.</text>

		<text>This report summarizes the intermediate results of research in the framework of the Observation-12 project. Information on the emerging logistics difficulties, instability in the behavior of experimental, the level of losses among subjects, as well as changes in the composition of personnel, technical failures and assessing the moral state of the collective are included. Data on the intervention of external structures and a brief analysis of the impact of experimental procedures on the course of the project are also given. \ n sash, collect everything and attach here!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lab_zapiska_nach_3_text">
		<text>The underground railway line connecting the main complex with external distribution points, failed at the 11th week of the project. The reasons are collapses in old tunnels and suspicions of sabotage. This led to a delay in the delivery of key components for up to 19 days. Some samples had to be removed from local reserves, which reduced the accuracy of experiments.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lab_zapiska_nach_4_text">
		<text>Since the launch of the project, there is a high degree of instability among experimental. Psychosomatic disorders, refusal to cooperate are manifested, and in several cases, self -overlap. Attempts to stabilize using standard tools have shown a short -term effect. The protocols were rewritten with the strengthening of physical control.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lab_zapiska_nach_5_text">
		<text>At the time of compiling the report, 49 deaths were confirmed, including 44 experimental and 5 lower -level employees. 90% of the subjects were previously convicted of particularly serious crimes and voluntarily chose to participate in the program instead of the death penalty. Formally, all the documents were signed, but the actual awareness of the participants remains in question.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lab_zapiska_nach_6_text">
		<text>Over the past 3 months, 7 unauthorized departures of employees with 3-4 levels of tolerance have been recorded. In informal reports, hallucinations, nightmares and an inexplicable feeling of "pressure" in the research sectors are mentioned. Two employees after leaving the complex were hospitalized with acute psychoses.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="lab_zapiska_nach_7_text">
		<text>Regular power outages in the sector B led to the failure of several surveillance cameras and automatic shut -off mechanisms. On June 14, the passionate of the experimental is recorded into the administrative zone, which ended with the death of the laboratory assistant ***. After the incident, additional levels of physical protection were established.</text>

		<text>Nobody expected the intervention of third -party interference. They agreed on some conditions, which, for some reasons, will be disclosed. I had to allocate a room for them. We requested a code castle. We must not forget to transfer to them that the code is 941523.</text>

		<text>During the internal audit, deviations from the approved protocols regarding the duration of the impact and the volume of applied agents were revealed.

		<text>The level of anxiety among the staff is growing rapidly. In conversations and personal diaries, numerous references to phrases like: “It has gone too far”, “We do not control the situation” and “They begin to understand”.
