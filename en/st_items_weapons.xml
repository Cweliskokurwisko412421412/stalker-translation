		<text>The Croatian submachine gun, created in the initial period of the Civil War in Yugoslavia. It was used by self-defense units, partisan-pure and sabotage-terrorist formations, as well as some units of the Croatian army, but was not officially adopted. The submachine gun turned out to be popular among criminals, since the weapon produced in wartime was not shot for the Pulegilzothek of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and (except for individual exhibition samples) did not even have labeling.</text>
